# Item 3: Minecraft Interactive Network
As someone who used to play Minecraft all the time—and still hops back in from time to time—I’ve always been fascinated by the crafting mechanic, which I believe is what made Minecraft such a unique game. However, I often found it a hassle to search online for crafting recipes for specific items or to figure out what certain raw materials were used for.

Outside of class, I’m working on a sustained research project at the UMBC Data Management & Semantics (DAMS) Research Group called the IoT Knowledge Graph Project, where I work extensively with networks and graph databases. Since I already had experience with network visualization, I came up with the idea to display the relationships between Minecraft items as an interactive graph. This would allow all crafting recipes to be stored in a centralized, user-friendly database—avoiding the overwhelm of scrolling through chunks of text. In this network, nodes represent Minecraft items, and directed edges indicate that one item is used as an ingredient in crafting another. Clicking on an item also opens a sidebar that shows its crafting recipe.

Initially, I planned to scrape data from the official Minecraft wiki, but I found that the pages were too disorganized for reliable extraction. I pivoted to unofficial Minecraft websites, which had more structured representations of crafting recipes. However, I ran into issues with bot detection while scraping, which taught me the value of seeking out open-source datasets before resorting to scraping.

In the IoT Knowledge Graph project, we used ArangoDB to host the graph. Wanting to make my Minecraft network easy to host locally and customizable with interactive features like a sidebar, I built the visualization using Cytoscape and Dash. Cytoscape is known for its ability to render large graphs and its interactive capabilities. The network was hosted locally using Dash, and while learning Cytoscape was a challenge at first, I eventually got the hang of it. I also encountered performance issues due to the number of nodes, so I implemented caching of the original network to reduce load times after the initial render.

Throughout the process, I learned that different graph tools are suited for different use cases. Dash and Cytoscape are great for building clean, interactive networks, while heavier graph databases like ArangoDB or Neo4j are more appropriate for rendering networks with thousands of nodes and edges. I also attempted to cluster nodes by item type, but doing so caused overlapping among nodes and edges, which made the network harder to interpret. I'm still wondering if there’s an effective way to cluster nodes by item type without causing overlaps—and if so, whether it would make the Minecraft network easier to understand.
